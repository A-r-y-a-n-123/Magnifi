                        U.S. Federal Reserve: In its last meeting of 2023, the Fed raised rates to a range of 5.25%-5.50%, 
                        The core inflation rate in the U.S. remained stubbornly above 4%, signaling that the Fed’s job is far from done.
                        Both European and British central banks followed suit with aggressive rate hikes over the past year, although they are now nearing their peak levels. The Bank of England, for instance, raised rates to 5.5%, marking a nearly 20-year high.
                        U.S. Stock Market: Despite some signs of resilience in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, many sectors, such as technology and real estate, have faced headwinds as interest rates remain high.

                        defender, into the morally compromised criminal lawyer Saul Goodman, a 
                        character made famous in Breaking Bad. Set in the early 2000s, the show 
                        explores Jimmy's relationships with his older brother Chuck McGill 
                        (Michael McKean), who is a successful lawyer, and his eventual descent 
                        into the morally gray world of legal manipulation and criminal defense.

                        produced by New Line Cinema. The film is based on the real-life paranormal

                        who are experiencing terrifying supernatural events in their Rhode Island 
                        farmhouse. As the Warrens uncover the dark history of the house, they face a 
                        powerful demonic entity that threatens the family’s safety.

                        Fiat Currency: Most modern currencies are fiat currencies, 
                        meaning their value is not backed by a physical commodity (like gold or silver)
                        but rather by the trust and authority of the government. Examples include the 
                        US Dollar (USD), the Euro (EUR), and the Indian Rupee (INR).
                        Commodity Currency: Historically, many currencies were based on commodities 
                        like gold or silver. For example, the gold standard was a system in which a 
                        country's currency was directly linked to a specific amount of gold.

                        focus on consolidating power, curbing political dissent, and reasserting 
                        Russia’s influence on the global stage. Putin has been involved in
